How to make reflection calculation less intensive:
>find equation of line that the ray is going to follow until it hits the wall(By=Ax+c) [where y and x are the coordinates
on the x-y plane, B and A are the the coefficients of y and x respectively and c is the y-intercept].
>find equation of surface of wall that the ray is going to hit (m,n)
>find point of intersection of the ray and the surface of the wall that the ray hits
>find coordinate that is the origin of the ray (r,s)
>find angle (a1) at which the a ray that originates from such a point (r,s) will hit point (m,n)
>calculate the path of reflection of a line that will now originate from point (r,s) [because it is the reflected ray] 
and make an angle a1 [because angle of incidence = angle of reflection]


Notes:
Though this algorithm seems to have a lot of steps, it is much simpler than the algorithm described in the issue post. 
Also the this is much less computing intensive and it wont require one to brute force unnecessary values.
